        text: "   His remarkable political career began with the return of democracy to Nigeria in 1998, following the death of General Sani Abacha who ruled Nigeria as a military dictator from 1993. In the run up to the 1999 elections, Diepreye Alaimeyeseigha, governorship candidate for the Peoples Democratic Party(PD), chose Dr. Goodluck Jonathan to be his running mate. The Alaimeyeseigha/Jonathan ticket won the election and he became the first civilian deputy governor of Bayelsa State on May 29, 1999 and were also re-elected in 2003. Jonathan’s diligence and loyalty to Governor Alaimeyeseigha earned him the recognition as the “most hardworking deputy governor” in Nigeria. He was also widely respected for his humility, sense of responsibility and loyalty. Goodluck Jonathan served as deputy governor of Bayelsa state until December 12, 2005, when he was sworn in as governor.     In 2007 he won the PDP Bayelsa State gubernatorial primary and was in the midst of his campaign when he was nominated to be the PDP presidential candidate, Governor Umaru Musa Yar’ Adua’s vice presidential running mate. The Yar’ Adua/Jonathan ticket won the election. Their victory marked the first peaceful transition of power from one elected civilian leader to another since Nigeria attained independence from Britain in 1960.     On May 29, 2007, Goodluck Jonathan took the oath of office as Nigeria’s Vice-President, the first time that a civilian from Nigeria’s South-South geopolitical zone would hold such a high political office in Nigeria Following President Yar’Adua’s prolonged treatment in Saudi Arabia and as a result of the national assembly’s adoption of the ‘Doctrine of Necessity’ resolution in the absence of a constitutional accommodation for such absences, Vice President Jonathan became Acting President on February 9, 2010. In line with constitutional provisions, after the unforeseen and unfortunate death of President Yar’ Adua on May 5, 2010, Jonathan was sworn in as President and Commander-in-Chief of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on 6th of May 2010, becoming Nigeria’s 14th Head of State.    In 2015, after a keenly contested presidential campaign and to the surprise of his opponents he conceded victory to General Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress via a phone call even before the final tally and formal announcement by the Independent National Electoral Commission. With this unprecedented action President Jonathan demonstrated commitment to peace and electoral transparency giving significance to one of his most repeated mantras-“nobody’s political ambition is worth the blood of any Nigerian. Against the backdrop of African and international commendation for the statesmanship, President Jonathan presided over the first peaceful transfer of political power from a ruling party to an opposition party in Nigeria culminating with the swearing in of President-elect Muhammadu Buhari as President/Commander in Chief on May 29, 2015.",
